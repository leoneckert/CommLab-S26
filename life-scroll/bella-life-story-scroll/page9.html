    <i>During the lunch break, a phone ring suddenly sounded in the quiet classroom.</i> 
    <i>The class monitor picked up the mobile phone that had fallen on the floor.</i>
    <i>No one admitted it was theirs</i>
    <i> —bringing mobile phones to school was against the school rules—</i>
    <i>so the monitor decided to hand the phone over to the teacher.</i>
    <br>
    <i>Suddenly a girl stood up and said: </i>
    <b>"Don’t give the phone to the teacher! It’s mine."</b>
    <br>
    <b>Now, help the girl get the phone back.</b>
