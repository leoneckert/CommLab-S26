    <i>The girl got her phone back, and the class monitor didn’t report her to the teacher. </i>
    <i>One day, classmates saw her taking photos with her phone on the playground.</i>
    <b>“I didn’t bring my phone to school just to play with it. I wanted to take pictures of the school to show Xiao Wang.”</b>
    <i>Xiao Wang was the girl’s deskmate, who had suspended school after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. </i>
    <i>The girl hoped to encourage him to return to campus.</i>
