                                                            The Justice Department released millions of new pages related to the 
                                                            convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Jon Elswick/Associated Press

                                                            Here’s What to Know About the Millions of Pages of Epstein Documents

                                                            Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche signaled that this would be the
                                                            last major release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein.
    
                                                            The Department of Justice on Friday released the largest batch of
                                                            Jeffrey Epstein files to date, a giant tranche including three million
                                                            more pages of documents and thousands of videos and <a href="map.html">images</a>.

                                                            The documents shed new light on the disgraced financier’s relationships
                                                            with several prominent figures, including Elon Musk, Bill Gates and 
                                                            Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. They also contain a significant number
                                                            of uncorroborated tips to law enforcement.

                                                            Congress mandated the release in November, and President Trump signed
                                                            the bill despite initially opposing it, as he has sought to put an end
                                                            to the accusations and speculation swirling around the case. The latest
                                                            batch of documents arrived weeks after a Dec. 19 deadline imposed by Congress.

                                                            Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the White House “had nothing
                                                            to do” with vetting the released documents. “They had no oversight and
                                                            they did not tell this department how to do our review and what to look
                                                            for and what to redact or not redact,” he said. Here’s what else we know
                                                            about the latest release of Epstein files.

                                                            The release was voluminous. 

                                                            The department released three million pages, 2,000 videos and some 
                                                            180,000 images at about 11 a.m. Eastern on Friday. The pages consist 
                                                            of email chains, text messages, news articles, internal investigative 
                                                            reports and other material tied to Mr. Epstein, a convicted sex offender.
